# The Deadly Cursed Enjmin Steamroller
Created in **48H** for the **ENJMAN 2022**

You're playing a cursed steamroller that must kill cultists to summon the demon that cursed you.

A demon cursed you into being a steam-werewolf-roller. In order to get your human form back, you have to roll over their minions, suck their blood in and paint the demonic symbol on the ground with it.
